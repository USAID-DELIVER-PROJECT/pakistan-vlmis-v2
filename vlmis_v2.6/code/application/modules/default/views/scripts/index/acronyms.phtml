                            <p>The Lecture Guide for the Three Credit Course on Supply Chain
                                Management of Public Health Commodities is meant for lecturers who
                                are supposed to conduct the course. This curriculum is written
                                following Adult Learning Theory principles which emphasize more
                                interactive and participatory approaches than traditional teaching
                                techniques. Small group exercises are placed into the curriculum
                                and Lecturers are encouraged to run these activities as written
                                where ever possible. The curriculum not only provides basic
                                principles for running a logistic system but includes elements that
                                are Pakistan specific. For this course each major unit of learning
                                is referred to as a Session and each section within is referred to
                                as an Activity. This course has 17 different Sessions. Lecturers
                                are highly encouraged to read the Lecturer Preparation section at
                                the beginning of each session well before leading each session.
                                Note that Synthesis Questions are presented at the end of each
                                Session. These can be used to ensure students are grasping the key
                                concepts of each session. Unlike the Certificate course this course
                                is competency-based.</p>
